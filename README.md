# aitios-sampling
Provides sampling functionality, for instance:

* Uniformly sampling a point on a `Triangle`, the `UnitSphere` or a `UnitHemisphere` with the Uniform trait,
* efficiently selecting a triangle out of a large set by area with `TriangleBins`,
* sequences of uniformly sampled points, e.g. `Poisson` for a poisson disk set obtained from triangles.
